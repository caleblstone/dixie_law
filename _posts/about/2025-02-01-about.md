Dixie Law is an artist and illustrator based in Ridgewood New York.Â 

She is influenced by comics, folk art, being outside for a while, listening to people, the bar, the subway and the intersection between text, image and narrative as it presents itself both visually and through the written word. She places heavy emphasis on words and multimedia figures that resemble the human body, focusing on her own life, family history and the absurdity we encounter day to day. She tackles these themes through drawing, printmaking, painting and animation.
